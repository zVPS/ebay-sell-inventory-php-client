This description should fully describe the product and the variations of the product that are available in the inventory item group, since this description will ultimately become the listing description once the first offer of the group is published. This field is not initially required when first creating an inventory item group, but will be required before the first offer of the group is published. Note: Since this description will ultimately become the listing description in a multiple-variation listing, the seller should omit the listingDescription field when creating the offers for each variation. If they include the listingDescription field for the individual offer(s) in an item group, the text in that field for a published offer will overwrite the text provided in this description field for the inventory item group. HTML tags and markup can be used in this field, but each character counts toward the max length limit. Note: To ensure that their short listing description is optimized when viewed on mobile devices, sellers should strongly consider using eBay's View Item description summary feature when listing their items. Keep in mind that the 'short' listing description is what prospective buyers first see when they view the listing on a mobile device. The 'full' listing description is also available to mobile users when they click on the short listing description, but the full description is not automatically optimized for viewing in mobile devices, and many users won't even drill down to the full description. Using HTML div and span tag attributes, this feature allows sellers to customize and fully control the short listing description that is displayed to prospective buyers when viewing the listing on a mobile device. The short listing description on mobile devices is limited to 800 characters, and whenever the full listing description (provided in this field, in UI, or seller tool) exceeds this limit, eBay uses a special algorithm to derive the best possible short listing description within the 800-character limit. However, due to some short listing description content being removed, it is definitely not ideal for the seller, and could lead to a bad buyer experience and possibly to a Significantly not as described (SNAD) case, since the buyer may not get complete details on the item when viewing the short listing description. See the eBay help page for more details on using the HTML div and span tags. This field is always returned if one or more offers associated with the inventory item group have been published, and is only returned if set for an inventory item group if that group has yet to have any offers published. Max Length: 500000 (which includes HTML markup/tags)

If successful, the response of the UploadSiteHostedPictures call will contain a full URL to the image on an eBay Picture Server. This is the URL that will be passed in through the imageUrls array.
